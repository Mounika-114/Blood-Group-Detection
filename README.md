#Blood Group Detection using Image Processing and Fingerprint Analysis

This project presents a deep learning based approach for blood group detection using fingerprint images. The system applies image processing techniques and a trained neural network model to classify blood groups from fingerprint patterns. A Flask web application is developed to provide a simple and user friendly interface for uploading fingerprint images and displaying prediction results.

The project demonstrates the integration of machine learning, image processing, and web technologies. It is intended for academic and research purposes and showcases how biometric data can be analyzed using deep learning models.
